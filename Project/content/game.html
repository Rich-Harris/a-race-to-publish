		<h3> About the game</h3>
		<p>Science: A Race To Publish (ARtP) is a fun and educational card game that helps players grasp the inner workings of science, as well as introducing famous scientists, theories and possible scientific career paths to players.

The aim of the game is to build a lab team to conduct research. How players do this is up to them. Will they collaborate with other players for mutual gain? Or will they be ruthless in trying to win, running the risk of reprisal from other players?

In the game players use their own teams of famous scientists and theories, and have to manage their cash flow successfully in order to win the game. 

The game is designed to educate and inspire players to discover more about the world of science, beyond what they read in textbooks or newspapers.
